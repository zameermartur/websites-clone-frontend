        The national anthem of India is "Jana Gana Mana" which was written by the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. The Anthem is written in high Bengali Sanskrit and is taken from the first five stanzas of a Brahmo Hymn, which was composed and scored by Rabindranath Tagore himself. The Anthem was first sung on 27 December 1911 in the Calcutta Session of the Indian National Congress and was officially accepted as the Indian National Anthem by the Constituent Assembly on 24 January 1950.
        
        The national anthem takes around fifty-two seconds to be played. The original poem was translated by Abid Ali into Hindi and the original Hindi version of the song was a little different. The text of Jana Gana Mana, though written in Bengali, is highly sanskritised and has been written almost completely with the use of nouns which can also function as verbs. Nearly all the nouns in the song are used in all major languages of India.
        
        
        The national anthem tell us that India is a diverse nation and there are differences in culture, traditions, religions and languages, but despite these differences, it reminds us that India is united under one flag. The anthem is significant in uniting people and reminding us that there isn't any difference among Indians.
        
        The Indian national anthem is played or sung at various occasions. From government offices to schools and colleges, the national anthem of India is sung at special occasions or national holidays or even daily as it is also titled as "The Morning Song of India".
        
        
        The national anthem of India is respected and proper observance and decorum is maintained when it is played on such occasions. All inhabitants are required to stand when the national anthem is played or sung.
        
        27 December 2011 marks the achievement of 100 years of Jana Gana Mana from the time it was sung for the first time.

A National bird should reflect the country’s culture and the Peacock is a magical creature with its beauty and grace and depicts the National spirit whose colors are synonymous with Indian identity.

                The Peacock, Pavo cristatus (Linnaeus), the national bird of India. It is symbolic of qualities like beauty, grace, pride, and mysticism.

                The male of the species is more colorful than the female, with a glistening blue breast and neck and a spectacular bronze-green train of around 200 elongated feathers it is able to expand its tail erect like a fan as an ostentatious display. The female is brownish, slightly smaller than the male, and lacks the train. These birds do not sound as beautiful as they look they have a harsh call. The elaborate courtship dance of the male, fanning out the tail, and preening its feathers is a beautiful sight.
                
                The peacock is widely found in the Indian sub-continent from the south and east of the Indus river, Jammu and Kashmir, east Assam, south Mizoram, and the whole of the Indian peninsula. Found wild in India (and also domesticated in villages) they live in jungle lands near water. They were once bred for food but now hunting of peacocks is banned in India.</p>

    <h2>Tiranga</h2>

    <P>The national flag of India, colloquially called the Tricolour, is a horizontal rectangular tricolour flag of India saffron, white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel, in navy blue at its centre. It was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became the official flag of the Dominion of India on 15 August 1947. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, the term "tricolour" almost always refers to the Indian national flag. The flag is based on the Swaraj flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress. Surayya Tyabji was the designer of today’s Indian National Flag but before that it was Pingali Venkayya who was the designer of first Indian National Flag which is today not the current Indian National Flag.

        By law, the flag is to be made of khadi, a special type of hand-spun cloth or silk, made popular by Mahatma Gandhi. The manufacturing process and specifications for the flag are laid out by the Bureau of Indian Standards. The right to manufacture the flag is held by the Khadi Development and Village Industries Commission, who allocates it to regional groups. As of 2009, the Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangha has been the sole manufacturer of the flag.
        
        Usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws relating to the national emblems. The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non-national flags.</P>

    <h1 id="vandemataram">5)NATIONAL SONG</h1>
    <h2>Vande Mataram</h2>
    <img src="./vande-mataram.jpg" alt="vande mataram image" height="400px" width="600px">
    <p>Vande Maataram (IAST: Vande Mātaram, also pronounced Bande Maataram; বন্দে মাতরম্, Bônde Mātôrôm transl. Mother, I bow to thee) is a poem written in highly sanskritized Bengali[1] by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee in 1870s, which he included in his 1882 Bengali novel Anandamath.[2][3] The poem was first sung by Rabindranath Tagore in the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress.[4][5] The first two verses of the song were adopted as the National Song of India in October 1937 by the Congress Working Committee prior to the end of colonial rule in August 1947.[6][7][8]

        An ode to the Motherland, it was written in Bengali script in the novel Anandmath.[9] The title 'Vande Mataram' means "I praise to motherland, Mother".[5][10] The "mother goddess" in later verses of the song has been interpreted as the motherland of the people –– Banga Mata (Mother Bengal)[11][12][13][14] and Bharat Mata (Mother India),[15][16] though the text does not mention this explicitly.
        
        It played a vital role in the Indian independence movement, first sung in a political context by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress.[17] It became a popular marching song for political activism and Indian freedom movement in 1905.[5] Spiritual Indian nationalist and philosopher Sri Aurobindo referred it as "National Anthem of Bengal".[18] The song and the novel containing it was banned by the colonial government, but workers and the general public defied the ban (with many being imprisoned repeatedly for singing it in public); with the ban being overturned by the Indian government after the country gained independence from colonial rule in 1947.[19][20]
        
        On 24 January 1950, the Constituent Assembly of India has adopted "Vande Mataram" as national song. On the occasion, the first President of India, Rajendra Prasad stated that the song should be honoured equally with the national anthem of India, "Jana Gana Mana".[21] However the Constitution of India does not have any mention of "national song".[22][23]
        
        The first two verses of the song are an abstract reference to mother and motherland, they do not mention any Hindu deity by name, unlike later verses that do mention goddesses such as Durga.[24][25] There are 65 seconds of circumstantial specification for the rendition of this song unlike the national anthem "Jana Gana Mana" that specifies 52 seconds.[26]

        Etymology
        The root of the Sanskrit word Vande is Vand, which appears in Rigveda and other Vedic texts.[27][note 1] According to Monier Monier-Williams, depending on the context, vand means "to praise, celebrate, laud, extol, to show honour, do homage, salute respectfully", or "deferentially, venerate, worship, adore", or "to offer anything respectfully to".[27][28] The word Mātaram has Indo-European roots in mātár- (Sanskrit), méter (Greek), mâter (Latin) which mean "mother".[29][30]</p>
